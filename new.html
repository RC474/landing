        <p><em>Trump’s</em> decision to fire Comey in May 2017 as the bureau investigated Russian interference in the presidential election triggered questions about whether the president was trying to obstruct justice. Comey has said he provided one of his memos to a friend with the hope of triggering the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russian meddling and any connection between Moscow’s effort and the Trump campaign.His hope was realized weeks later when the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel.
            The White House doubled down on Trump’s criticism of Comey on Thursday, saying Comey’s actions triggered a “politically motivated, two-year witch hunt,” referring to Mueller’s investigation.<p>
            
            <p>“The Inspector General’s report shows Comey violated the most basic <strong>obligations of confidentiality</strong> that he owed to the United States Government and to the American people, ‘in order to achieve a personally desired outcome,’” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement, quoting from the inspector general report.  </p>
